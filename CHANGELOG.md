## 2021-02-20

### Fixed

- fixed button toggle on "pause" in ```index.html``` file
- added natsort to help with sorting videos better in a directory

## 2021-02-19

### Added

- added redis-server and the python redis library as dependencies

- support for seeking to a specific point in a video file using the ```/api/control/seek``` endpoint
- new configuration setting ```allow_seek```. Will toggle the ability to seek in the web interface to avoid seeking on accident

### Changed

- moved the current program status, last played file status, and player configuration options to redis instead of flat files. This should help reduce read/writes to the SD filesystem
- made the program "paused" by default on first run. This gives the user a chance to edit settings before starting
- return some generic "no file loaded" messaging if requesting status and no last played file information
- separated the "find video" logic into it's own class so it can be reused elsewhere

### Removed

- removed saving individual video information files. These weren't read in for any real reason any more since the last played status had everything needed

## 2021-02-18

### Changed

- moved files to ```modules``` directory to keep local python source files a bit cleaner
- changed menu to separate player from analyzer controls

### Removed

- removed legacy ```analyze.py``` file as it has been merged into the web service

### Fixed

## 2021-02-12

### Added

- added ability to refresh config while program is running. Adjustments to ```config.json``` file will update config without program restart

## 2021-02-11

### Added

## 2021-02-04

- dump all file info to ```last_played.json``` and reload this when continuing the same file instead of re-probing the file each time

### Fixed

## 2021-02-03

### Added

- Added ability to extract title information from the video file, if it exists

### Changed
