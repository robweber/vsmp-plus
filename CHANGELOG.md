## 2021-03-11

### Fixed

- fixed issue with analyzer where Remaining Time To Play wasn't loading current position of video correctly

## 2021-02-22

### Added

- added Device IP as a valid display option as part of the configuration. Helpful when trying to find the device on the network.
- when no video loaded display message with address of web management page on display
- player status (paused or running) included as part of ```/api/status``` command
- show next run time as part of ```/api/status```
- include next run time on web display
- use boot strap icons to show some icons in various areas

### Fixed

## 2021-02-20

### Fixed

- fixed button toggle on "pause" in ```index.html``` file
- added natsort to help with sorting videos better in a directory

## 2021-02-19

### Added

- added redis-server and the python redis library as dependencies

- added buttons to web interface for prev and next when in directory mode
- support for seeking to a specific point in a video file using the ```/api/control/seek``` endpoint
- new configuration setting ```allow_seek```. Will toggle the ability to seek in the web interface to avoid seeking on accident

### Changed

- moved the current program status, last played file status, and player configuration options to redis instead of flat files. This should help reduce read/writes to the SD filesystem
- made the program "paused" by default on first run. This gives the user a chance to edit settings before starting
- return some generic "no file loaded" messaging if requesting status and no last played file information
- separated the "find video" logic into it's own class so it can be reused elsewhere

### Removed

- removed saving individual video information files. These weren't read in for any real reason any more since the last played status had everything needed

## 2021-02-18

### Changed

- moved files to ```modules``` directory to keep local python source files a bit cleaner
- changed menu to separate player from analyzer controls

### Fixed

- fixed error when no last_played.json file existed, how handled correctly

## 2021-02-12

### Added

- added ability to refresh config while program is running. Adjustments to ```config.json``` file will update config without program restart

## 2021-02-11

### Added

- added Flask based web service with some basic endpoints. will eventually allow for on the fly program control

### Changed

- moved some global values to the utils file to be used more generally

## 2021-02-04

- dump all file info to ```last_played.json``` and reload this when continuing the same file instead of re-probing the file each time

### Fixed

## 2021-02-03

### Added

- Added ability to extract title information from the video file, if it exists

### Changed

- changed ```-t``` to ```-D``` (display). This allows for displaying the video title, timecode or both through the use of ```-D title timecode``` or just ```-D timecode``` as examples

## 2020-12-29

### Added

### Changed

- updated Install document
- use [configargparse](https://pypi.org/project/ConfigArgParse/) library instead of argparse as found in the @missionfloyd branch
